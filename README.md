# The Odoo BA: Custom Solutions Portfolio
A portfolio of custom Odoo 19 business applications and technical tutorials built by an Odoo Business Analyst.

🌱 **Learning in Progress:** This repository tracks my journey as a Business Analyst providing technical as well as functional solutions. 

You will see my code evolve from basic tutorial exercises to complex, business-ready customizations. My core philosophy is to **leverage Odoo's standard functionalities as much as possible**, only writing custom code to extend standard features for specific, high-value business requirements.
